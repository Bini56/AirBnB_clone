## Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! The goal of this project is to build a full web application that replicates the functionality of AirBnB. This README provides an alternative explanation of the project and its first step: building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

## Project Overview
The AirBnB clone project consists of multiple tasks that are interconnected and build upon each other. The first task is to create a command interpreter that will be used to manage the objects within the AirBnB project. This command interpreter is similar to a shell, but it is specifically designed for the AirBnB use case.
